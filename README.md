Auto report CPU Usage with auto update feature

This was a project completed for a computer systems programming course. The goal of the assignment was to read and calculate CPU usage statistics from a server ever second, and to display the statistics on a webpage. The user would then have the option to select to enable an auto-update feature, where the statistics would be updated every second as the statistics changed. The backend is written in C++, and the frontend is in html, css, and javascript.
